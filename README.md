# customer churn prediction
In this repository I analysed the customer churn in telecom business. 

I used  deep learning model of ANN (Artificial Neural Network) to predict the customer churn. Since the number of customers leaving vs customers staying with the telecom business in this dataset is imbalance, I used different methods to deal with it.  The outcomes showed that SMOTE method perform better than other methods for dealing the imbalance data in the current dataset.
